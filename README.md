The best encryption program I ever saw on the internet. You write text and password(ALL characters are allowed) and then you save it to an encrypted file. This is VERY GOOD protection for files and it comes with a form of (encrypted)file manager.

***BONUS*** for SUPER skill programmers : I added a file called trythis.txt. Try to decrypt it!!!

THIS CODE YOU MUST SEE!!!!
 
### More Info
